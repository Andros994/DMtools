# The tools are optimized to work on desktop view and could have layout issues on mobile or tablet

The software is composed by different tools that you can navigate on the sidebar on the left

- Iniziative tracker: you can add different enemies, players and npc, creating cards for each one in which you can insert name (or generate a random one), max PF and initiative. You can then order all of them by initiative
  from the highest one.
- Music: Two playlist with some copyright-free musics for combat and exploration
- Dice Roller: you can input the rolls that you want (es. 1d20, 4d6) separated by commas if you want multiple rolls. You can then check if you want to see each dice roll result or just the sum of them or both.

If you have any other suggestions about tools or bugs let me know
